# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
A Python-based machine learning project to predict medical insurance costs using demographic and health-related features.

This project focuses on predicting medical insurance costs using Machine Learning techniques in Python. The model analyzes factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region to estimate individual insurance charges.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and prediction.

🔧 Technologies Used
